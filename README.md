## 👋 Hi there, I'm Nilson

I'm a Unity developer passionate about creating interactive systems, card-based mechanics, and turn-based logic.  
I enjoy building modular and reusable code in C#, exploring gameplay design, and prototyping innovative mechanics.  
Currently, I'm focused on expanding my Tic Tac Toe-inspired card game project with deck-building and combo systems.
